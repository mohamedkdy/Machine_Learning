## Machine learning road map
 Machine Learning is the: field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. â€”Arthur Samuel


# Week 1
## Pick a language
I chose Python because it is the best for this.

Why? Easy syntax, extensive documentation, great community, availability of resources.

## Create a GitHub profile and learn Git

Git is a powerful version control system that every single person in the STEM field should learn.
GitHub is a way of showing the world you know something. Simply writing, I know Python will not be enough for companies.
You have to prove you know the Python by showing your projects.
